        <p>Perform this procedure if you have Home Assistant 13.1 or later and you want to do a factory reset. If you have a new device, you likely have an older version of Home Assistant Operating System (older than 13.1).

       A device reset wipes the data partition of your device. It removes all user data as well as Home Assistant Core, Supervisor, and any installed add-ons. The Home Assistant operating system stays on the system.</br></br>
      Once a device wipe is initiated, the data partition is marked as to be cleared on boot. Then, the system reinstalls the latest version of all Home Assistant components.</p>
