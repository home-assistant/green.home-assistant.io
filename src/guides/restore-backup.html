      <span
        ><p>There are two ways you can use a backup:
          <ul>
            <li>You can use a backup to recover your existing configuration on your current system.</li>
            <li>You can use a backup during the onboarding process to restore your configuration. For example, if you want to migrate from another device to a Home Assistant Green.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>  
        
        <p>A full backup includes your system configuration, add-on data, automations, scripts, and media stored on Home Assistant.</p></span

        <span>If you want to migrate your configuration from another device, make sure the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os/#restoring-a-backup-during-onboarding">
            prerequisites</a>  are met. Specifically, check the size of your current installation. Home Assistant Green has 32&nbsp;GB of disk space, so your installation needs to be a bit smaller than that.</span>

      <li>
        <span>Start up Home Assistant Green as described in the <a href="/">
            Getting started</a> procedure.</span>
